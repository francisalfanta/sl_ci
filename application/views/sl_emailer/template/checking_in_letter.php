I hope this letter finds you and your family in good health and spirits. I am just checking in to see how everything is going with your new home: how do you like the neighborhood? Are you able to find the services and resources you need to acclimate to your new abode? 

As you know, I greatly value the business and personal relationship that I have with you and want to ensure that you and your family are happy and comfortable in your new place. If you found my services helpful, please consider referring any friends, family, or colleagues my way. Again, thank you for supporting me and my business endeavors!
