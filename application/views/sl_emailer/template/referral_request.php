<ul>
	<li>Real estate sales</li>
	<li>Real estate purchases</li>
	<li>Real estate home staging</li>

	<li>Local real estate market expertise and guidance</li>
	<li>Real estate professional referrals (for those moving to another state or country)</li>
	<li>Real estate leasing (commercial, industrial, retail, residential)</li>
	<li>Other: do you have a unique real estate issue that you need assistance with? I am happy to work with you to find solutions.</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
